The periodization and progression strategies recommended for strength and hypertrophy vary significantly based on the user's assessed training age, reflecting the expected rate of progress and the required complexity of the program.

The general principle for all levels is to align initial weekly training volume with training age: **Novice (10–12 sets/wk)**, **Intermediate (13–15 sets/wk)**, and **Advanced (16–20 sets/wk)**.

Here are the summaries for block/periodization across the different training age levels:

## 1. Novice Trainee (Expected Progress: Workout-to-Workout)

Novices benefit from a simple strategy focused on mastering movement and achieving linear gains.

| Feature | Description | Strength/Hypertrophy Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Progression Model** | **Single Progression** (or Linear Load Increases). Progression is simple: add weight while keeping sets and reps static. Complex periodization is not necessary for maximal adaptation. | Applies to both goals. If the goal is hypertrophy, increased strength is a key sign of progressive overload and adaptation. |
| **Progression Mechanism** | If target reps are achieved, increase the load for the next session: **5–10 lbs (Lower Body)** or **2.5–5 lbs (Upper Body)**. | Strength programs may use a daily undulating model (DUP) where different rep/load combinations (hypertrophy, power, strength) are used on different days, but the progression for each lift remains linear (single progression). |
| **Failure/Stall Logic** | If the user misses target reps (failure) in **two consecutive sessions**, the system applies a **10% load reduction (RESET)** for the next workout. The subsequent session returns to the stalled load. | Primarily applicable to compound lifts using percentage of 1RM (%1RM) assignments. |
| **Volume Baseline** | 10–12 sets per muscle group/movement per week. | The training schedule should be built to train each muscle group or movement pattern at least **2+ times per week**. |

## 2. Intermediate Trainee (Expected Progress: Week-to-Week/Monthly)

Intermediate trainees require a structured progression to manage increasing fatigue and stimulate continued growth. The primary model is Linear Periodization, specifically through wave loading.

| Feature | Description | Strength Focus (Wave Example) | Hypertrophy Focus (Wave Example) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Progression Model** | **Linear Periodization** using 3-week **Wave Loading** microcycles. Intensity increases while volume decreases over the 3 weeks. | Load increases by 5–10 lbs each week while repetitions drop by 1 (e.g., 3x8, 3x7, 3x6). | Load increases by 5–10 lbs each week while repetitions drop by 2 (e.g., 3x12, 3x10, 3x8). |
| **Accessory Progression** | Uses **Double Progression**. The user aims to increase repetitions within a predefined range (e.g., 12–15 reps) until the top of the range is hit for all sets, before increasing the load and resetting the repetition target to the bottom of the range. | Used for lifts where load increases are difficult or unrealistic (e.g., isolation lifts). | Used for isolation and machine lifts where load increases are hard. |
| **Periodization Cycling** | After every 3-week cycle, a **Post-Block Assessment** is performed using a checklist (sleep, stress, aches). If the score indicates fatigue (2 or more negative responses), a **Deload Week** is scheduled. A deload is mandated every third mesocycle regardless of assessment. | The deload typically involves **50% of normal training volume** while maintaining load but reducing reps to lower the RPE (e.g., 3x10x200 lbs becomes 2x8x200 lbs). | Deload settings are usually 2 sets per exercise at Week 1 load (light intensity). |
| **Volume Baseline** | 13–15 sets per muscle group/movement per week. | The wave loading approach ensures that despite fluctuations, the **total volume load increases** from one cycle to the next due to strength gains (heavier starting loads). |

## 3. Advanced Trainee (Expected Progress: Month-to-Month/Block-to-Block)

Advanced trainees require a Block Periodization approach to intentionally manage fatigue over long periods (macro-cycles) and specialize training focus to break plateaus.

| Block Phase | Duration | Primary Goal & Progression | Settings for Advanced Lifters (General) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accumulation** (Volume Focus) | 4–6 Weeks | **Hypertrophy & Work Capacity**. Progression prioritizes adding **Sets or Reps** first, then Load. Volume increases progressively throughout the block (e.g., from 12 sets/wk to 22 sets/wk over 6 weeks). | Sets: 4–5; Reps: **8–15**; RPE: **6–8** (submaximal effort to encourage recovery). |
| **Intensification** (Strength Focus) | 3–4 Weeks | **Specific Strength**. Progression prioritizes aggressive **Load increases** while decreasing volume. Volume reduces from the accumulation phase (e.g., drops from 22 sets/wk to 12 sets/wk). | Sets: 3–4; Reps: **3–6**; RPE: **7–9**, or up to **8–9.5**. |
| **Realization** (Taper/Test) | 1–2 Weeks | **Peaking** / Dissipate accumulated fatigue to express maximal strength. | Volume: **50% reduction** of Intensification volume. Intensity: Maintain high load (90%+ 1RM) with very low reps (Singles/Doubles), keeping RPE low (e.g., **RPE < 7**) to manage fatigue. |
| **Introductory Cycle** | 1 Week | To facilitate acclimation when starting a new block (especially transitioning from Intensity to Accumulation), the system automatically uses **75% volume** and lowers the **Target RPE by 1 point**. | Applicable when transitioning phases or returning from an extended break (>14 days, where a 20% load reduction is also suggested). |

### Summary of Intensity Distribution by Goal

The overall intensity distribution for strength and hypertrophy is consistent regardless of training age (Intermediate/Advanced), though the volume baseline increases with experience.

| Goal | Primary Volume Distribution (⅔ – ¾ of total volume) | Secondary Volume Distribution (remaining ¼ – ⅓ of total volume) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strength Focus** | **1–6 rep range**. This heavy work promotes skill and neuromuscular adaptations. | **6–15 rep range**. This lighter work helps build muscle mass and work capacity. |
| **Hypertrophy Focus** | **6–12 rep range**. This is the most practical range for accumulating volume efficiently. | Split between **1–6 rep range** (for progressive overload/strength complement) and **12–20 rep range** (for local muscular stimulus/joint health). |

The progression models serve as a set of blueprints for manipulating training variables over time. Just as a contractor uses different blueprints—a simple plan for a shed (Novice Linear Progression), a more complex sequential plan for a house (Intermediate Wave Loading), or an integrated phased plan for a skyscraper (Advanced Block Periodization)—each blueprint matches the complexity and long-term goals of the construction project, ensuring that adequate materials (volume/load) are used at the right time to support the next stage of growth.
