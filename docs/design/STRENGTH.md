When the purpose of a workout is to improve **strength** and specifically increase performance in the **Big 3 lifts** (Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift), the training must prioritize the muscle groups essential for executing these lifts (specificity) and simultaneously target supporting musculature to address any "weak links in the chain".

For strength goals, **50–75% of the total training volume** must be dedicated to the competition lifts and their direct variants.

The main muscle groups to target are determined by the cumulative demands of these three highly specific compound movements:

### 1. Lower Body and Hip Extension (Squat and Deadlift)

These movements primarily target the musculature responsible for hip and knee extension, with substantial involvement from core stabilization.

| Lift | Primary Muscle Targets | Secondary/Supporting Muscles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Squat Pattern** | **Quads** (Primary muscle for squat pattern) | **Glutes**, **Hamstrings**, Adductors, Spinal Erectors (Lower Back) |
| **Deadlift Pattern** | **Hamstrings** (Primary for conventional deadlift), **Glutes**, **Spinal Erectors** (Lower Back) | Quads, Traps, Forearms (Grip), **Lats** (Back stabilization) |

**Consolidated Lower Body Targets:**

*   **Quads** (Knee extension, critical for squat depth and recovery).
*   **Glutes and Hamstrings** (Powerful hip extensors, critical for both squats and deadlifts).
*   **Spinal Erectors / Lower Back** (Crucial for trunk stability and rigidity under load in both lifts).

### 2. Upper Body Push (Bench Press)

This lift targets the muscles that execute horizontal pushing and are supported by the upper arm:

| Lift | Primary Muscle Targets | Secondary/Supporting Muscles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bench Press** | **Chest** (Pectorals) (Primary) | **Front Delts** (Anterior Deltoids), **Triceps** (Elbow extension and lockout) |

**Consolidated Upper Body Push Targets:**

*   **Pectorals** (Chest).
*   **Anterior Delts**.
*   **Triceps** (The triceps act as a primary mover and stabilizer in the lockout phase).

### 3. Upper Body Pull and Stabilization (Accessory Work)

While the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift are the primary focus, supplementary work (25–50% of volume) must target opposing and stabilizing muscle groups to maintain structural balance and address technical weak points. These groups include:

*   **Lats and Upper Back Musculature (Scapular Retractors, Rhomboids, Traps):** These muscles are vital for **Deadlift stabilization** and creating the rigid, supportive *shelf* required to press against during the **Bench Press**. They are typically trained through **Horizontal Pulls** (Rows) and **Vertical Pulls** (Chins/Pulldowns).
*   **Biceps:** These are secondary movers in pulling movements and assist in stabilizing rows.
*   **Forearms/Grip:** Specifically targeted for improving **Deadlift** performance if grip strength is a limiting factor.

In a comprehensive strength program, these targets are organized into three main categories of movement/muscle groups to ensure all areas contributing to the Big 3 lifts receive adequate training stimulus:

1.  **Lower Body**
2.  **Upper Body Push**
3.  **Upper Body Pull** (incorporating Deadlift movement patterns).
