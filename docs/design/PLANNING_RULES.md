The planning principles for strength and hypertrophy-focused workouts are primarily differentiated by the specific goals related to **Intensity of Load** (rep ranges) and **Exercise Selection** (specificity vs. variety), while adhering to common guidelines for overall volume and frequency.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the planning principles based on the sources:

## General Planning Principles (Volume, Frequency, Progression)

These foundational principles apply regardless of whether the focus is strength or hypertrophy:

### 1. Volume (Total Sets per Week)

*   Volume is tracked primarily by counting the **number of sets performed per muscle group or movement pattern**.
*   The general recommended range for most novice and intermediate lifters is **10–20 sets per muscle group/movement pattern per week**.
*   Volume should be established based on training age and increased only when progress has plateaued and recovery is sound.
    *   **Novices** typically start at **10–12 sets per week**.
    *   **Intermediates** typically start at **13–15 sets per week**.
    *   **Advanced** trainees may require **16–20 sets per week**.
*   The **"Overlap" Rule** must be considered: volume is calculated by adding 1.0 set to the primary muscle and a fractional factor (e.g., 0.5 or 0.75) to each secondary muscle group involved in a compound movement.

### 2. Frequency

*   Training frequency should be **2 or more times per week** per muscle group or movement pattern to maximize gains and efficiently distribute volume.
*   As volume increases (e.g., for intermediate and advanced lifters), training frequency often needs to increase (up to 3–5 days/week per muscle group/movement) to maintain quality and prevent individual sessions from becoming too long or fatiguing.

### 3. Progression & Intensity of Effort (RPE)

*   The training stimulus must **gradually increase over time** (The Principle of Progressive Overload).
*   **Intensity of Effort** should be managed using the **RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion) scale** (based on Repetitions in Reserve—RIR).
*   Most training volume should occur in the **5–10 RPE range**. RPE 10 signifies failure (0 RIR), RPE 9 is 1 RIR, and RPE 8 is 2 RIR.
*   Training to absolute failure (RPE 10) should generally be avoided for heavy, multi-joint compound lifts due to high injury risk and excessive systemic fatigue, but may be used for accessory/isolation movements.
*   **Progression Models:**
    *   **Novices** use **Single Progression**, adding load session-to-session while keeping reps/sets static.
    *   **Intermediates** use **Linear Periodization (Wave Loading)** for compound movements (load increases, reps drop over a 3-week cycle) and **Double Progression** for isolation movements (reps increase within a range before load increases).
    *   **Advanced** trainees use **Block Periodization** (Accumulation, Intensification, Realization) across multi-week cycles.

### 4. Rest Periods and Tempo

*   **Rest Periods:** The primary principle is to **rest until ready** to perform the next set at your best.
    *   **Compound Lifts** generally require longer rest (defaulting to **2.5–5 minutes**).
    *   **Isolation/Machine Lifts** may be shorter (**1.5–2 minutes**).
*   **Tempo:** Prioritize **load and volume** over counting seconds. Use a controlled eccentric (lowering phase) to set up for a forceful concentric (lifting phase), but avoid unnecessarily slow tempos (>4s eccentric) as this can reduce total volume and impulse.

## Strength Focus (Powerlifting) Planning Principles

The goal is increasing maximal force production (1RM), requiring high specificity and sufficient muscular development.

| Principle | Detail | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intensity (Heavy/Lighter Sets)** | **⅔–¾ of the volume** must be performed in the **1–6 rep range** (heavy loads), with the remaining volume (¼–⅓) in the 6–15 rep range. | |
| **Primary Goal** | **Specific Strength:** Develop strength (neuromuscular adaptations and skill) on the competition lifts, supported by hypertrophy work to increase muscle mass. | |
| **Training Load/RPE** | Specific strength training sets (main lifts) typically fall into the **7–10 RPE** range. Technique or "Power" work uses very light loads or high loads far from failure (e.g., **4–7 RPE, 1–3 reps**). | |
| **Exercise Selection** | **Specificity Check:** **50–75% of total training volume** must be derived from competition lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift and their direct variants). | |
| **Accessory Work** | **25–50% of total volume** is dedicated to accessory movements (used to address weak links in the main lifts or prevent injury/pain). | |
| **Progression (Intermediate Example)** | Uses Wave Loading patterns like: **Week 1:** Target 8 Reps @ BaseLoad; **Week 2:** Target 7 Reps @ BaseLoad + 5lbs; **Week 3:** Target 6 Reps @ BaseLoad + 10lbs. | |
| **Advanced Block Focus** | **Intensification Phase:** Lower volume (**12–15 sets/wk**), lower reps (**3–6 reps**), high RPE (**8–9.5**) to prioritize load and specific strength. | |

## Hypertrophy Focus (Bodybuilding) Planning Principles

The goal is maximizing muscle growth, driven primarily by mechanical tension and sufficient volume, with less reliance on high specificity of movement or load.

| Principle | Detail | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intensity (Heavy/Lighter Sets)** | **⅔–¾ of the volume** should be performed in the **6–12 rep range**, with the remaining volume (¼–⅓) split between the 1–6 rep range (for progressive overload support) and the 12–20 rep range (lighter loads). | |
| **Primary Goal** | **Volume accumulation** is paramount; the load must be heavy enough (above ~30% 1RM) and the effort adequate (**5+ RPE**). | |
| **Training Load/RPE** | Compound machine/free weight hypertrophy movements typically use RPE **6–9**. Isolation movements often push harder, using RPE **7–10**. | |
| **Exercise Selection** | Must ensure **balanced development**. Includes **1–2 compound exercises** and **1–3 isolation exercises** per major muscle group. | |
| **Exercise Order** | Compound/Multi-joint exercises are sequenced **before** Isolation/Single-joint exercises for the same muscle group to maximize performance on fatiguing lifts. However, if a muscle group is a weak point, isolation work for that area may be performed first, provided it doesn't hinder subsequent compound lift performance. | |
| **Progression (Intermediate Example)** | Uses Wave Loading patterns like: **Week 1:** Target 12 Reps @ BaseLoad; **Week 2:** Target 10 Reps @ BaseLoad + 5lbs; **Week 3:** Target 8 Reps @ BaseLoad + 10lbs. | |
| **Advanced Block Focus** | **Accumulation Phase:** Higher volume (**16–20 sets/wk**), higher reps (**8–15 reps**), moderate RPE (**6–8**) to prioritize volume and work capacity. | |

**Analogy:**

If building a physique or strength goal is like constructing a building, **Volume, Intensity, and Frequency (VIF)** are the raw materials (steel, concrete, time allocated). **Strength-focused training** is like building a skyscraper that must withstand immense pressure; you must devote the majority of your highest-grade materials (heavy sets/intensity) to the core foundation (competition lifts) because the structure's purpose is highly specific. **Hypertrophy-focused training** is like building a complex museum with many specialised wings; the material quality (intensity/load) can vary more widely (6–12 rep range), but the volume must be distributed across a wider variety of materials (compound and isolation exercises) to ensure every part of the structure is proportionally enlarged.
